   <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-full-stack-cloud-developer" target="_blank">Full Stack Development Course</a>
      
      <p>  Full stack development is the end-to-end development of applications. It includes both the front end and back end of an application. The front end is usually accessed by a client, and the back end forms the core of the application where all the business logic is applied. A full stack developer requires skills such as Front-end Languages and Frameworks (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). As a full-stack developer, you know of multiple technologies. Whether it's about adding images to a web page or creating a database, you'd be familiar with all of them. This gives you an edge over other developers because you can make technical decisions faster and see the big picture.
